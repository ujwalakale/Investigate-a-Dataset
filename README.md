# Investigate-a-Dataset

This project which i chose from the list is of No-show/Show Appointments. The csv file for the project is available on the link provided and i will be exploring this file in the below sections of code and markdown cells mainly to check if any duplicates and null or missing values or absurd values in the dataset and will be taking the actions accordingly and will also mention sectionwise what all actions i am taking at each step going forward.

In this project mainly i will try to find the answer for the typical Question of "Why No-Show happened for a paitent" and what are the main factors responsible for the No-Show and how can we correctly predict in future based on this dataset in abest possible way wether a person with certain information will Show-up for the future Appointments or not?
